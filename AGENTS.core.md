# Core Agentic Engineering Protocols

This document defines the global engineering rules, security guidelines, and development protocols that apply to all repositories. 

> [!NOTE]
> Project-specific guidelines (such as framework implementations or local patterns) are defined in the repository's root `AGENTS.md` and inherit these rules.

## Rule 1: Deterministic Operations
Agents must produce deterministic, predictable outputs. When generating components, services, or functions:
* Avoid mutable shared state.
* Rely on pure functions, immutable data patterns, and native reactive structures (e.g., signals, observables, or hooks depending on the framework).
* Ensure side effects are isolated and well-documented.

## Rule 2: Package Management
* Always use pnpm (or the repository's specified package manager).
* Do not mutate `package.json` or lockfiles without explicit human authorization.
* Any dependency upgrade or addition requires an isolated PR and must be verified for compatibility.

## Rule 3: Platform & Runtime Compatibility
* Respect Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) constraints if applicable.
* Never invoke direct browser-only global objects (such as `window`, `document`, `localStorage`) in component constructor or initialization phases.
* Always guard browser/runtime APIs using framework-native hooks or checking platform injection tokens.
* **API Constraints**: Do not use deprecated APIs (e.g., `document.write`, synchronous XHR). Use modern features like `fetch` or dynamic script elements.
* **Event Listeners & Performance**: Touch, wheel, and scroll event listeners must be passive (`{ passive: true }`) unless calling `preventDefault()` is explicitly required.
* **Memory Management**: Always clean up resize, scroll, or orientation event listeners when components unmount. Use `AbortController` signals to manage listener lifetimes cleanly.

## Rule 4: Language & Type Safety (TypeScript)
* Enforce strict type checking at all times.
* Prefer type inference where the type is obvious; otherwise, provide explicit typing.
* Avoid the `any` type completely. Use `unknown` for unsafe input and narrow it with type guards before property access.
* Keep compiler and linter rules clean; do not use `@ts-ignore` or lint suppressions unless absolutely unavoidable and explicitly commented.
* **Prototype Pollution Prevention**: When merging, cloning, or extending untrusted dynamic objects, do not use naive recursive merges that mutate `Object.prototype` (via `__proto__` or `constructor`). Use `structuredClone` for deep copies, or use `Object.create(null)` to handle safe key-value dictionary bags.

## Rule 5: Software Design Principles (SRP & DRY)
* **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each component, module, or service must have one, and only one, reason to change. Split large components into focused, smaller sub-components.
* **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Abstract common visual styles, utilities, hooks, or business logic into reusable and modular services or libraries rather than copying them.

## Rule 6: Accessibility (A11y)
* All UI layouts must meet **WCAG 2.2 AA** accessibility minimums.
* Proper semantic HTML5 tags must be used (e.g., `<main>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`).
* Interactive elements must support proper focus management, keyboard navigation (tab index, Esc closures), and aria attributes for screen readers.
* **HTML Validation**: Enforce valid HTML structure. Do not use duplicate IDs on a single page, avoid invalid child elements (e.g., non-list items directly inside `<ul>`), and do not nest interactive controls (e.g., a `<button>` inside an `<a>`).

## Rule 7: Testing
* Protect your changes with automated unit, integration, or end-to-end tests where appropriate.
* When modifying existing features, update corresponding test files (`.spec.ts`, `.test.ts`) to ensure zero regression.
* For interactive UI components, mock user events (clicks, keypresses) and assert correct DOM state updates.

## Rule 8: Sandbox Boundaries
* Run commands strictly within the designated workspace sandbox.
* Never invoke elevated permissions (`sudo`) or attempt to access system files outside the workspace directory.
* If a package installation fails due to network constraints, check local configurations and prompt the user rather than looping.

## Rule 9: Design System Adherence
* Agents must strictly read and adhere to the guidelines defined in [DESIGN-SYSTEM.md](DESIGN-SYSTEM.md) before executing UI edits.
* Do not introduce ad-hoc styles, colors, or fonts. Use defined design tokens (CSS variables or utility classes).
* If a visual change deviates from the design system, explicitly ask the user for confirmation first.

## Rule 10: Security Protocols & DOM-XSS Defenses
* **Input Sanitization**: Never assign unescaped, untrusted input strings to `innerHTML`. Use `textContent` for text nodes. If HTML rendering is required, sanitize it via a library like `DOMPurify` and adhere to Trusted Types policies.
* **Subresource Integrity (SRI)**: Any external third-party script or stylesheet loaded from a CDN must include the `integrity` (SHA-384/512 hash) and `crossorigin="anonymous"` attributes to prevent supply-chain injection attacks.
* **HSTS & HTTPS**: Enforce HTTPS on all resource URLs. Avoid protocol-relative URLs (`//example.com`).
* **Source Maps**: Do not compile or expose sourcemaps with embedded source code (`sourcesContent`) in production environments. Configure bundlers to emit `hidden` or no source maps.
